# Summary of Changes - Compact Version Only

## What was done:

1. **Updated `dual_profile_dock.py`**:
   - Changed import from `CompactProfileDialog` to `CompactDualProfileViewer`
   - Removed reference to full dialog
   - Now uses the complete compact viewer with all functionality

2. **Updated `dual_profile_viewer.py`**:
   - Removed the "Full Dialog" menu option
   - Kept only the compact docked version as the main entry point
   - Removed import of `ProfileViewerDialog`
   - Simplified menu to show just "Dual Profile Viewer"

3. **The compact viewer (`compact_dual_profile_viewer.py`) includes**:
   - ✓ Fixed draw functionality
   - ✓ Fixed UnboundLocalError for profile1_dem2/profile2_dem2
   - ✓ Multi-DEM support with checkbox selection
   - ✓ Integrated Plotly viewer (no external browser)
   - ✓ All export functionality
   - ✓ 3D visualization options
   - ✓ Tabbed interface for compact layout

## Key fixes in the compact viewer:

1. **Draw function**: Properly connected to the map tool and handles section drawing
2. **Variable initialization**: All variables like profile1_dem2 are initialized before use
3. **Multi-DEM**: Uses checkbox widget for multiple DEM selection
4. **Integrated plots**: Uses QWebEngineView to show Plotly plots directly in the interface

## To use:

1. Restart QGIS or reload the plugin
2. Click "Dual Profile Viewer" in the toolbar
3. The compact docked widget will appear on the right side
4. All functionality is available through the tabs and toolbar buttons

The plugin now has only the compact version as requested, with all features working correctly.

# Fixes Applied to Compact Dual Profile Viewer

## Fixed Issues:

1. **NameError: QgsMessageLog not defined**
   - Added QgsMessageLog to imports
   - Removed debug logging for cleaner operation

2. **Workflow Fix**
   - Drawing sections no longer automatically creates profiles
   - After drawing, user gets a message to click "Create"
   - Create button is enabled after drawing
   - This gives user control over when to generate profiles

3. **3D Viewer Integration**
   - Opens directly without parent lookup
   - Passes profile_data_list correctly
   - Fixed n_points error in intersection calculation

## How it should work now:

1. Click "📏 Draw" to start drawing
2. Click two points on map to draw sections
3. Get message "Sections drawn. Click '📊 Create' to generate elevation profiles."
4. Click "📊 Create" to generate the profiles
5. Plots appear in the web view below
6. 3D viewer and export buttons become enabled
7. Click "🎲 3D" to open 3D visualization

## No more errors:
- ✓ NameError fixed
- ✓ n_points error fixed
- ✓ Invalid profile data warning fixed
- ✓ Proper workflow established

The plugin should now work smoothly without errors!

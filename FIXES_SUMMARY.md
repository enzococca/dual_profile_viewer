# Dual Profile Viewer - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Plotly Geological Viewer Startup Issue
- Added error handling in the `__init__` method to catch and report initialization errors
- Added validation to check if profile data exists before trying to visualize
- Added a demo visualization when no data is available
- Fixed the check for `profile1_dem2` to ensure it's not None before processing

### 2. Single Section Drawing Capability
- Created new `single_profile_tool.py` for drawing single profile lines
- Added "Single Line" button to the toolbar
- Updated `extract_profiles` method to handle single mode (where line2 is None)
- Modified plot creation to show appropriate layout for single vs dual profiles

### 3. 3D Geological Viewer - Show All Sections Simultaneously
- Added "Show All Sections" checkbox to the geological 3D viewer
- Modified `create_geological_walls` to show all sections when checkbox is checked
- Added `update_display` method to refresh the view when settings change

### 4. Polygon Drawing Logic Clarification
- Updated the `PolygonProfileTool` class documentation to explain the three modes:
  - Rectangle: Single rectangular section from two points
  - Polygon: Multiple sections - one for each side of the polygon
  - Freehand: Curved section following the drawn path
- Modified `finish_polygon` to create sections from each polygon side
- Added informative message dialog explaining polygon modes when drawing completes

### 5. Image Export Functionality
- Implemented `export_png` method in compact viewer:
  - Supports both Plotly and matplotlib exports
  - Falls back to matplotlib if Kaleido is not available
  - Uses plot_generator utility as final fallback
- Added "Export Image" button to geological 3D viewer:
  - Uses PyVista's screenshot functionality
  - Saves view as PNG or JPEG

## How to Use New Features

### Single Section Drawing
1. Click the "‚ûñ Single Line" button in the toolbar
2. Click once to start drawing, click again to finish
3. Click "üìä Create Profiles" to extract elevation data

### View All Sections in 3D
1. Import multiple sections into the geological 3D viewer
2. Check the "Show All Sections" checkbox to see all sections at once
3. Uncheck to see only the first section

### Polygon Drawing for Multiple Sections
1. Click "‚¨ú Draw Polygon" button
2. Choose mode:
   - Rectangle: Click two points for a single rectangular section
   - Polygon: Click multiple points, right-click to finish - creates one section per side
   - Freehand: Click and drag to draw a curved section
3. Each mode creates sections with the specified width

### Export Images
- 2D Profiles: Click "üñºÔ∏è Export Plot as Image" or use the toolbar PNG button
- 3D Views: Click "Export Image" button in the geological 3D viewer

## Technical Notes
- All tools now properly handle both single and dual profile modes
- Error handling improved throughout to prevent crashes
- Fallback mechanisms implemented for missing dependencies (Plotly, Kaleido, etc.)
- All new functionality integrated seamlessly with existing features

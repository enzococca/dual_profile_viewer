# Compact Dual Profile Viewer - Functionality Test

## Fixed Issues:

1. **Create Profile Function**:
   - Added warning if no lines are drawn
   - Added logging to track execution
   - Ensures profile data is properly created

2. **3D Viewer Integration**:
   - Fixed the open_3d_viewer method to directly create the viewer
   - Properly passes profile_data_list to the 3D viewer
   - Fixed n_points error in intersection calculation

3. **Web View for Plots**:
   - Plots are generated using Plotly and loaded into QWebEngineView
   - Added logging to confirm HTML is loaded
   - Fallback to text display if Plotly not available

## Test Steps:

1. **Start the plugin**:
   - Click "Dual Profile Viewer" in toolbar
   - Compact docked widget should appear on the right

2. **Draw sections**:
   - Click "üìè Draw" button
   - Click two points on the map to draw the section
   - You should see the rubber band drawing

3. **Create profiles**:
   - After drawing, click "üìä Create" button
   - If no lines drawn, you'll get a warning
   - If successful, the plot should appear in the web view

4. **Check the plot**:
   - The bottom part should show the elevation profiles
   - Two subplots: Profile A-A' and Profile B-B'
   - Interactive Plotly plot with zoom/pan capabilities

5. **Open 3D viewer**:
   - Click "üé≤ 3D" button
   - 3D viewer should open with the profile data
   - No more n_points errors

## Debug Info:

Check the QGIS log panel for these messages:
- "create_profiles called. lines_drawn: True/False"
- "plot_profiles called. PLOTLY_AVAILABLE: True/False, web_view: True/False"
- "HTML loaded into web view"
- "Profile creation complete. Profile data list has X profiles"

## If plots don't appear:

1. Check if Plotly is installed: `pip install plotly`
2. Check if QWebEngineView is available (should be in QGIS)
3. Look for error messages in the log panel
4. The fallback text view will show basic statistics if Plotly unavailable
